If you're adding a lot of samples together, script it. Start by making a file with your directories.

for i in {0..8}; do echo -n "/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias$i/crab_EraE2022_EZB${i}_updated_conf/" >> temp.txt; eosls /store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias${i}/crab_EraE2022_EZB${i}_updated_conf/ >> temp.txt; done


Either copy and paste the output or pipe it to a file.

Now hadd each sample individually (usually each sample will have two directories, one 0000 and one 0001)

Here's the command to execute, except it just echos expressions instead of actually hadding the samples.

i=-1;
for line in `cat temp.txt`; 
do i=$(($i+1)); 
echo $i; 
echo $line/0000; 
echo $line/0001; 
sample=EZB${i}_2022F;
echo ${sample}.root ${sample}_0000.root ${sample}_0001.root; done

Here's the command to execute when you're satisfied your expressions are correct.

i=-1;
for line in `cat temp.txt`;
do i=$(($i+1));
sample=EZB${i}_2022F
hadd ${sample}_0000.root `xrdfsls -u $line/0000 | grep '\.root'`;
hadd ${sample}_0001.root `xrdfsls -u $line/0001 | grep '\.root'`;
hadd ${sample}.root ${sample}_0000.root ${sample}_0001.root;
rm ${sample}_0000.root ${sample}_0001.root;
done

Here's the same command, but in the case that only 0000 directories are available
i=-1;
for line in `cat temp.txt`;
do i=$(($i+1));
sample=EZB${i}_2022E
hadd ${sample}.root `xrdfsls -u $line/0000 | grep '\.root'`;
done
