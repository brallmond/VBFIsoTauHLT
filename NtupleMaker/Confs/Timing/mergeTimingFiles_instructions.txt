use xrdfsls and the directory of your completed files to make a txt document of their location

xrdfsls /store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias5/crab_EZB5_UnprescaledL1Repack_AllRuns/211210_213025/0000 | grep '\.root' > EZB50000files.txt
xrdfsls /store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias5/crab_EZB5_UnprescaledL1Repack_AllRuns/211210_213025/0001 | grep '\.root' > EZB50001files.txt

next, split the larger text document into two smaller ones using one of these scripts

. splitInputFileList.sh EZB50000files.txt > firstHalfEZB50000files.txt
vi EZB50000files.txt
d500d
:wq
mv EZB50000files.txt secondHalfEZB50000files.txt

now use edmCopyPickMerge to add about 500 files together

manually update the input file inside of getInputFiles.sh to the text file you're adding
edmCopyPickMerge inputFiles=`. getInputFiles.sh` outputFile=part1EZB5.root

do this two more times, and then add all 3 parts together

edmCopyPickMerge inputFiles=file:part1EZB5.root,file:part2EZB5.root,file:part3EZB5.root outputFile=EZB5UpsL1sAllRuns.root

save this to eos on cmslpc

xrdcp ./EZB5UpsL1sAllRuns.root root://cmseos.fnal.gov//store/user/ballmond/EZBUpsL1sAllRunsMerged/

now delete your files and repeat (it's necessary to delete them due to size constraints)

rm *EZB5*

look into increased quota or removing old files
