vnc to confDB must be done from lxplus

vncserver -localhost -nolisten tcp -geometry 1880x970 :2

2 is usually good, but sometimes you'll need to use 3 or 4 if 2 is taken.

Now open a new terminal from your laptop/desktop (i.e. not on lxplus) and do

ssh -fN -Y -L 5902:localhost:5902 ${USER}@lxplus${lxplusServerNumber}.cern.ch;

The "2" in 5902 is meant to match the number of the previous command (2 in this example).
You must include the lxplus server number you're ssh'ing to (it's in the handle of your lxplus session).
From local, do the following. Password for vnc was setup in a previous step from instructions online.

xvnc4viewer localhost:2

A screen should open. On that screen, open a terminal and
if it's your first time, you need to clone the repo, otherwise just cd and clean/start the GUI.

git clone https://github.com/cms-sw/hlt-confdb.git
cd hlt-confdb
ant clean
./start

kill the server on lxplus when you're finished with it

vncserver -kill :2;
