First, make a file that looks like this

/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias2/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB2/220404_022758/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias3/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB3/220404_022846/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias4/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB4/220404_022939/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias5/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB5/220404_023026/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias6/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB6/220404_023113/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias7/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB7/220404_023157/
/store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias8/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB8/220404_023246/

with commands like this
eosls /store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias1/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB1_retry/
or
for i in {1..8}; do num=$i; eosls /store/user/ballmond/EphemeralZeroBias${num}/crab_Pre6Rate_EZB${num}/; done

Next, append "0000" to the end of each line with this command in vi (or do it by hand)
:%s/$/0000
we'll do this step again with "0001" for the second set of directories.

Once you have this file, you're ready to hadd. simply do this

n=1; for word in $(cat Pre6RateFileLocations.txt); do hadd EZB${n}_Pre6Rate_0000.root `xrdfsls -u $word | grep '\.root'`; echo $((n++)); done

This produces a hadded file of all files in the 0000 directory of your EZB output, and it does it for each directory in the file generated above.

Next, change 0000 to 0001 in your file of directories and run the above command again.

Now you have two hadded files for each directory in each EZB sample. Now we just hadd those two together for one final file.

for i in {1..8}; do num=$1; hadd EZB${num}_Pre6Rate.root EZB${num}_Pre6Rate_0000.root EZB${num}_Pre6Rate_0001.root; done

Have fun with your new rate samples!
