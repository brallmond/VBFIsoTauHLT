get counts for differnt L1s
think about how to make flags/counters for passing Old Offline Selection and passing fake L1s+Offline

make new sample with ele-tau HLT available [x]
include single electron HLT (dangit)

add END filter objects for both HLTs (might decide not to match the electron?)
  how can I even use the electron one without an HLT matched object?

if an object is in an offline collection, why do we bother matching to HLT?

make offline selection section for that


match to those

compare output/overlap (see how much our trigger would add on what is already captured)

consider an additional sample. Is VBF the place where this trigger will have the largest impact? probably
